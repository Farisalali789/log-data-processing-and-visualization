# Stepper Motor Data Analyzer

This repository contains a Python script for processing and analyzing log data from a stepper motor. The script reads a log file (`stepper.log`), validates the data using a checksum, calculates the total distance traveled, and generates a plot of voltage over time. The processed data is also saved to a CSV file.

## Features
- **Checksum Validation**: Ensures data integrity by validating each line in the log file.
- **Distance Calculation**: Computes the total distance traveled based on position data.
- **Threshold Detection**: Identifies when a specific distance threshold (e.g., 20 meters) is reached.
- **Data Export**: Saves processed data to a CSV file (`Output for stepper.csv`).
- **Visualization**: Generates a scatter plot of voltage over time with a linear regression line.

## Requirements
- Libraries: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `datetime`

## Usage
1. Place your `stepper.log` file in the same directory as the script.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python stepper_analyzer.py
